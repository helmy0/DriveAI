# DriveAI

Using machine learning, I created a ML model which uses the Neat libraryb neural network to train car objects. 
With each generation the cars drives faster and better to create an optimal driving pattern.
The model used 5 input layers, 0 hidden layeras and 2 outputs. 
The input 5 input layers represent the 5 radars mounted on the car, at different angles, and their proximity to the grass (; off track limits).
